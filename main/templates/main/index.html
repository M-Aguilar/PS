	<p class="lead">This is Moises Aguilar's presonal website page.</p>
	<p class="lead">This is my site. Enjoy. There is not much to see at the moment. It is a work in progress. I used to have a complete-ish site I promise. I lost it. I know. I preach backing up then fail to do so myself. I've learned my lesson and this one should last. Check out some of my games or look at some of my projects. I am learning all the time and would love constructive feedback. But not really. I have many ideas and passions that I want to puruse and am continually coming across problems to solve and interesting topics. The only drive in this work is that I keep challenging myself to be better. There is so much knowledge out there worth granting attention. I still don't know what I want this site to be, besides a tool for landing a good job. Otherwise, there are literally endless possibilities for what I can attach or mold this thing into. As you can see hopefully from this site is I don't limit myself and neither should you.</div>
